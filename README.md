# OOFEM_inFile_viewer
Python script reads in-file and generates schemaStruct.html.

in this project:
axi01.oofem.in - as input file.
schemaStruct.html - as output file.

Output is a html file, so it can be included in any web project, in future.


I did not upload any python libraries, so if you want run, you use Pycharm Community and copy this code into new project. Pycharm Community will create your desired libraries.
